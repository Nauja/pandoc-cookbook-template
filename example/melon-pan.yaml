notes:

  - '<p><strong>Instant Dry Yeast: </strong>If you''re using active dry yeast, it requires being activated in a little bit of warm water (110F/43C) before being added to the rest of the ingredients. In this recipe, add the active dry yeast in 110F/43C milk, hotter than the temperature specified in the recipe because if the milk is not hot enough, the yeast won''t dissolve nicely.
